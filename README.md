# OscarScraper
A webscraper that allows easy access to some important Academy Awards questions.

Two basic .java files, when combined with a JSoup library (download option provided by github), will provide answers to quintessential Academy Awards questions the common public has every year they happen. A modest attempt at webscraping The Oscars(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) wikipedia page.
